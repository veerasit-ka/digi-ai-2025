### Text Classification
## Task Requirement (15 points):
* Use the sentiment dataset to classify the text into Positive or Negative sentiment. Follow the instructions below:
    * You can build your models using statistical methods (e.g., TF-IDF, Bag of Words, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) or neural networks (e.g., RNN, LSTM, GRU) to classify the test set.
    * The provided dataset contains only the test set, so you are not allowed to use it for training. You must explore or create your own training dataset to perform the classification task.
    * (5 points) – Preprocess the data and generate a training dataset.
    * (5 points) – Model development: Build at least 3 models. You can earn extra points if you apply advanced techniques or demonstrate good performance.
    * (5 points) – Analyze and compare the results from each model. Present your findings clearly.

## Provided Test Dataset:
- Contains 2 sentiment classes: Positive and Negative
